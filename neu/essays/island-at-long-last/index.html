I'm not entirely sure where the dark overtones come from, nor the Siren theme. It's not like I often think about sea-dwelling homicidal nymphs.</p>

		 <p>Those adrift at sea might sight it,<br>See shelter from the storm.<br>And moor their ship and wander<br>This island long forlorn.</p>
		<p>“At long last we’ve made it!”,<br>The captain might declare,<br>Unb&#39;known to him the dreary<br>Night that&#39;s to become his lair.</p>
		<p>For when night has fallen<br>And sleep comes to them all,<br>That sweetest wail will beckon<br>From that cold, remorseless mare.</p>
		<p>See, this island hides a secret<br>That few have lived to share.<br>The captain’s men shall know it<br>As they’re driven to despair.</p>
		<p>The sirens, unforgiving<br>Escort them to their graves,<br>A gentle chant now guides them<br>To a realm beyond these waves</p>
		<p>Day breaks on the island<br>And silence greets the shore,<br>But a lone ship to remember<br>What befell the night before.</p>
		<p>Many moons have passed since<br>And that ship no longer stands,<br>On the horizon, two lost seamen<br>Revel &#39;pon what they’ve chanced:</p>
		<p>“At long last we’ve made it!”<br>Shouts the fellow to his mate.<br>As they celebrate their fortune<br>The sirens lie in wait.</p>
