    <h1>※ G o o d M o r n i n g ※</h1>
    <h2>I'm David Blue - an automotive journalist on sabbatical and self-described <em>Software Historian</em>.</h2>
    <p>It's good to be here!</p>
    <p>By that I mean, it&#39;s especially nice to feel welcome here even though <strong>I am in no way a software
        developer</strong>. </p>
    <p>I use the term <em>Software Historian</em> because I have found myself especially fascinated with the origin
      stories of the platforms and services we use in the past 3-4 years, especially regarding Word Processors.</p>
    <p>My <em>ultimate</em> software development aspiration would be to build my own CMS with Python from scratch, but
      I&#39;m not just being humble when I tell you that I am <em>very</em> far away from doing that.</p>
    <p>Recently, I have been toying with the idea of writing a <em>Literary History of Streaming Music</em>, directly
      inspired by Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum&#39;s <a
        href='https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076'><em>Track Changes: A Literary History of Word
          Processing</em></a>, continuing the work I began in one of my all-time best essays <a
        href='https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music'><strong>examining the Holiness of Bandcamp</strong></a> as a
      technology company who can do no wrong.</p>
    <p>I&#39;m sure anyone reading this can relate when I lament that <em>I really should get around to writing an
        updated bio</em>, but I&#39;ve already spent enough time on this one, I think. Let me just <em>quote myself</em>
      from my blog&#39;s about page:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I’ve already born witness to innovation bridging divisions between people throughout the greatest informational
        renaissance my species has ever seen... Originally, I wrote about our relationship with <strong>cars</strong>
        (<a href='https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review'>2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review</a>) and now
        <strong>technology</strong> (<a href='https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music'>Bandcamp: Streaming&#39;s
          Secret Savior</a>) from a perspective that feels tedious or abstract to some, but is generally entertaining,
        through-and-through. I’m proud of the work I’ve done so far, which has been wild, absurd, reflective, and
        hilarious — occasionally all in the same work as I develop my voice.</p>

          me</a> about literally anything</strong>. </p>
